<p style="text-align:center;"><u> Short Biography</u></p>
  <hr> 
  <p1> Hello, my name is Erica Ramirez and I was a fourth year Public Health Policy major with a minor in Health Informatics. A fun fact I always like to share is how I am allergic to cats, however, given my little sister is the favorite child, I am fortunate enough to have not just one cat in the house but 3! </p1>

<p2>UCI was always my dream school growing up. In elementary, every Friday a class would present a University or College. In 3rd grade, my class was given UCI to present. I was amazed by how beautiful it looked I would always say "When I'm older I want to go to UCI" and here I am years later on my fourth year.</p2>

  <p5> I work at the UCI Public Health Dean's office as a student administrative assistant. I have been working here for about a year now and have learned so much. I did not expect to learn what I have so far but I am very glad I did. It has allowed me to gain experience in creating contracts, reimbursements, and financial expenses. Working here has been great and I enjoy it so much more as I am surrounded by such amazing and supportive people. </p5>

  <p6> Week (02/12-15/2024) </p6>

 Today is Monday, I went for a quick walk with my dog this morning. I did a few chores and meal prepped for the week. When it was time to pick up my sister, I took my dog on a car ride to pick her up from work. I came back home and watched Chicago Fire until it was time to complete my night routine. </p7>

  Today is Tuesday, and I had to wake up super early for class. If you see my schedule above, I have an 8am which is not my favorite. It ended up being such a lucky day for me that class was canceled after I drove almost an hour to get to Irvine. Oh, I also forgot to mention, today is my birthday but I refuse to tell many people because then I will have to accept the fact that I am getting older. I also went to work today and it went by pretty fast.</p8>

  Today is Wednesday, the belly button of the week! I love Wednesday's. Valentines is the day of love but I was so tired all I was looking forward to was drinking some coffee at work. Today at work I had to train a new employee. I sometimes find it quite unique how I am student training individuals who are now Professors or have their Masters. It's like an uno reverse card since now I get to be the instructor and they're my student. As much as I enjoy training new individuals, I do not know how Professors do it when lecturing. After talking for about ten minutes I had to keep drinking water, so I sincerely applaud professors. It takes great skills to be able to talk and have students engaged for over an hour.  </p9>

  Today is Thursday and the last day of my blogging. As exciting as this was, I entered about a weeks worth of my daily life. I'm sorry to say I am not so interesting and most of my daily tasks repeat. But I have been blogging with pure honesty and thoughts that come into my head. Maybe this is more like a diary than a blog. I just don't express many feelings but that's also because I tend to be quite awkward and silent. I am not sure if I am a good writer or not, but I am trying my best. I do have a short rant for today. On the syllabus for my 8am class it said 'TBA' for today's lecture. I go to sleep at around 9:30pm on Wednesday's and I checked the Canvas announcements to see nothing had been mentioned about lecture. I assumed we would have it and I was right. When I woke up in the morning the Professor made an announcement at 10:05 PM and said "Lecture in Person, arrive on time. We will have a guest Speaker." First of all, I was quite annoyed by how late the announcement was made as I believe it is respectful to give notice ahead of time. Anyways, I woke up early, drove to Irvine, and walked to class. I get there and after waiting a couple of minutes it is 8:05 am and there is no professor. The amazing Ta's were there however. There was a guest speaker and she did an amazing job, she was actually my TA for IN4MATX 171. After class, I went to work and complained to my supervisors about the situation I explained above. Well I didn't complain they just asked what was wrong as I seemed upset and explained what happened. However, I am looking forward to going to I&CS 10 later today as it is one of the classes I have where the Professor genuinely cares about the students and the information being taught.
